This is a Puredata patch for playing music and manipulating video in realtime.
It uses Gem and should work with Puredata Extended.
It is made up of some older patches I made along with the doc examples and community patches over many years.  There is a four channel mixer with built-in eq and effects, a sequencer with some example synths and samplers, and a video mixer using Gem.  There are some experimental parts that are unfinished.  The user will need to add samples and video files.  Gem also needs the correct codecs on the system for video playback.  The basic flow is to send signals from the music controllers/sequencers/levels to the video mixer.  Currently there is a kickdrum signal that is sent to zoom in on the video for every hit.  One of the synth parameters is also hooked up to fade between the two video signals.  This is just one example, Gem can also create realtime visuals through opengl, etc.  Hopefully the patch will be of some use or at least inspire some ideas.  The code/design is free under licenses compatible with the doc examples and other authors.
